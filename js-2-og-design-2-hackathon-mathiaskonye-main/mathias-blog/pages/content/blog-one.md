# My next.js Experience.

This is my first time using next.js. I have been touching on React a little while ago, but never got into it so its nice to get some practise like this. Also I`m using css modules with this website. Next.js was very confusing at first but with some research and learning a little more about it, it is not that hard to use and I should be able to master it with more practise.

At first I did the tutorial on the next.js webpage. That helped me a little bit, but nothing is better practise than to do stuff by my self like trying out some of the feautures and doing my own research. Im still not 100% at this obviously, but it shouldn`t be that hard to learn.
